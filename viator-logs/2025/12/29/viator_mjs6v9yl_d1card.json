          "description": "This experience is designed around you — not a fixed route or a highlights checklist.\n\nBefore your time together, your local host learns what you’re curious about, what you’ve already seen, and how you like to explore a city. From there, you shape the experience together and adjust as you go.\n\nRather than rushing between sights, the focus is on understanding Tokyo through neighborhoods, everyday places, and conversation. You may spend time in well-known areas or quieter local streets, but the emphasis is always on context, insight, and moving at a pace that suits you.\n\nThis experience works best for travelers who value flexibility, local perspective, and depth over trying to see everything in one day.",
