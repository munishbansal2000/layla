The area’s wonderful natural scenery has a long history of drawing Buddhist and Shinto practitioners, and it is also the final resting place for Tokugawa Ieyasu, \nthe founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan.\nWhen you visit Nikko, you can't miss Nikko Toshogu Shrine and Kemangafuchi, which you may not be able to stop by on other tours.\nYou can also feel the charm of nature at the overwhelmingly powerful Kegon Water Falls. There are many local cuisines you can enjoy such as yuba(tofu skin), Rainbow trout, etc...\nNikko is a must when visiting Japan.",
