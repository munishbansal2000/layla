In two hours, we’ll slip into the city’s darker side—where legends, ghost stories, and spine-tingling folklore come alive.\n\nThis tour really is for everyone: curious kids, adventurous teens, history buffs, and anyone who just loves a good thrill and Halloween vibe.\n\nAs we wander the medieval streets of Île de la Cité, your guide will share the kind of tales that give you goosebumps: a murderous barber who terrified the neighborhood, ghosts said to linger in royal chambers, and strange immortals who still haunt Parisian lore. Every corner hides a secret, and every landmark—whether it’s the Hôtel de Ville, Notre Dame, or Conciergerie—has something eerie to reveal.\n\nWith a small group (never more than 8), it feels more like exploring the city with friends—friends who happen to love a good spooky story. Together, we’ll share an unforgettable Halloween evening in the City of Light… and shadows.",

        "description": "Gathering at the foot of the iconic structure, your guide will unravel the enigmatic tale surrounding the Eiffel Tower's creation in the late 1800s. For years, engineers grappled with the quest for the perfect design until a mysterious figure emerged, armed with advanced mathematical calculations that baffled all others. Was this elusive persona the namesake himself, Gustave Eiffel, returning from beyond the grave to oversee his magnum opus?\n\nDescending into the shadows beneath the intricate ironwork, we'll seek echoes of the countless souls who met tragic fates during the tower's construction. From harrowing falls to equipment mishaps, the early days of the tower bore witness to no shortage of mortal drama. Some insist that the ghosts of those lost linger within the landmark to this day. \n\nWill you witness paranormal phenomena firsthand amidst the heights of Paris after nightfall? The only way to find out is to join our Eiffel Tower Exterior: Ghost & Haunted Walking Tour",

They've found an old journal and are trying to solve the mysterious disappearance of its owner. The old notes contain descriptions of a Headless Horseman haunting Paris. Maybe the journal also offers the clues needed to find out what happened? You are invited to join an investigation, but one of your new friends never shows up at your agreed meeting spot. Follow clues through Montmartre. Participate in the story in each location through gamification. Examine items and crack codes while you explore the city's historical surroundings. This audio walking tour game is self-guided via a GPS-based app downloaded to your phone. When you buy the tour you'll receive an email with instructions on how to download the app which serves as your guide and narrator. Listen to the story while you walk, and solve puzzles in each location. You can start, pause and end the tour when you want.",
