You will be amazed how easy they are to operate and able to go to a maximum speed of 20mph. After a safety orientation and practice ride, you will be ready to head up to the Red Rock Canyon on a 4-mile bike lane before entering the Red Rock National Conservation Area. Once inside the park, you will glide along the 13-mile canyon paved scenic byway to reach an elevation of 4,800-feet with many places to stop.",
