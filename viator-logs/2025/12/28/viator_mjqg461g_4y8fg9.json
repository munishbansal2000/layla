Hard to tell the taxi driver to go to the meeting point in Japanese? sweaty after the tour? No worries! (If your hotel is out of the range, let's discuss the starting point. Additional charges to be applied.)\n\n#2. e-bikes\nWe use e-bikes, so the motor will assist you when you pedal. It's a relaxing activity. You don’t have to worry about the hill any more! \n\n#3. Private\nWe will propose a route but this is a private tour, so you can go wherever you want with your own pace. You can also make requests such as changes of starting time, extension of the tour duration, or visits to certain spots. Tell your requests when you sign up. (Additional charges to be applied for each request) \n\nOur tours range from 15-20km, from skyscrapers to back streets in Tokyo, with multiple short stops along the way to give commentaries and let you drink up. Let's enjoy the breeze while cycling.",

        "description": "If your goal is just cosplay, this isn’t for you. This is where Samurai train Mind and Skills, grounded in the strength of Bushido. In two hours, you’ll take your first true step as a samurai.\n\nKendo means “the way of the sword” in Japanese. It began as the samurai’s method of training in sword combat, wearing armor and striking with bamboo swords. In the world of the samurai, where a blink could mean death, even the slightest disturbance of the mind was fatal, so they trained the mind as well.\n\nYou’ll begin with an introduction to kendo’s history, philosophy, and rules. Learn proper etiquette, then train in the three key elements of kendo: spirit, sword, and body in unison. Practice striking techniques, step into real sparring matches, and witness the instructor’s skills in a true kendo bout.\n\nThis is for those who truly wish to take their first step toward becoming a samurai.\nEvery step into this dojo is a step into the way of the warrior.\nAwaken your Strength in Bushido.",
